Loaded dice simulator
By: Anoop Yadav

0). Introduction
* Uses the Alias Method as described in http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins/
* Basically, the loaded dice is simulated by means of a fair dice roll and a biased coin toss.

1). How to run
* Untar the archive using "tar xvf LoadedDice.tar.gz"
* Type "make"
* Type "dice <input_file>" to execute.
* All commands to be executed without quotes.

2). Assumpions made
* I'm assuming that the input file will be syntactically correct.
* The program does no error checks on input other than checking for an input file.
